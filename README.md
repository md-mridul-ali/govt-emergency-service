##  Question 1

###  Difference between `getElementById` and `getElementsByClassName`

**getElementById:**
1. Select by Id name
2. Returns a single element
3. Unique 
4. Access a specific element

**getElementsByClassName:**
1. Select by Class name
2. Returns multiple elements as a HTML Collection
3. Not unique
4. Access multiple elements

---

###  Difference between `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`

**querySelector:**
1. Returns the first matching element
2. Do not support direct looping 
3. Behavior is similar to selecting by Id

**querySelectorAll:**
1. Returns all matching elements as a NodeList
2. Supports looping 
3. Behavior is similar to selecting by Class

##  Question 2  

###  Create and Insert a New Element into the DOM  

**Create a new element:**  
const newElement = document.createElement("div");

**Insert a new element into the DOM:**
const body = document.getElementById("body");
body.appendChild(newElement);

## Question 3  

###  Event Bubbling and How It Works

**Event Bubbling:**  
Event Bubbling is a way of event propagation in the DOM where an event starts at the target element and then bubbles up to its parent elements one by one until it reaches the `document`.

**How It Works:**  
- When we click on a child button, it triggers the event on the button first and shows its own inner text.  
- Then the event bubbles up to the parent element and triggers the parentâ€™s event.  
- After that, it continues to the grandparent element and so on.  
- The bubbling stops when the event reaches the `document`.

##  Question 4  

###  Event Delegation and Why It Is Useful

**Event Delegation:**  
Event delegation is a technique where we attach a single event listener to a parent element to manage events for its child elements, even if they are added dynamically.  

**Why It Is Useful:**  
-  Better performance, fewer event listeners  
-  Faster and less memory usage  
-  Clean code, easier to manage  
-  Supports dynamic elements, works for elements added later

##  Question 5  

###  Difference between `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`

**preventDefault():**  
-  Stop the default behavior of an element  
-  Do not stop event bubbling  

**stopPropagation():**  
-  Do not stop the default behavior of an element  
-  Stop the event from bubbling up to parent elements
